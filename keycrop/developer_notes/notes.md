# Keybindings to add

- Changed the basil to bean (update your keybindings), and change the space to chilli in the code and keybindings. 
- Add five stages, and all five plants
- Fix "cache" so it actually works
- make it display nicely in the inventory and fully switch between views, plants included. 
- Add a greyed out version of the plants so they know what they are aiming towards. 
- Add a closing for if you finish the game. 
- Add some sort of intro or explanation. Hints on which keys to use?


- Formatting all code contains multiple "when" conditions and used in different contexts such as notebooks. See `ctrl+shift+i`
- change from div to img...everywhere 
- store past plants so we don't always have to restart the game
- "media" javascript files could/should be refactored into typescript
